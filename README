With all this talk of "graceful browser degradation" who is speaking for the other side? With this plugin, visitors still using Internet Explorer 6 get the experience their browser demands.

Current features:

* Comic Sans fonts everywhere!
* Emphasis tags (bold, italic, strong, and underline) blink! Even though IE doesn't support the <blink> tag!
* <hr> tags become animated rainbows!
* Animated mailbox graphic added to "mailto:" links!

Future features:

* "Best Viewed in Internet Explorer" icon in the footer!
* Maybe other things!
